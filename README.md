# LeechLatticeAnimation
A Haskell program to find the 3D "shadows" of the Leech lattice as it undergoes a rotation.

Goals:
* Make a Haskell program to find n/m-th powers of a symmetry matrix of the Lecch Lattice
* * Probably use Fourier series with Data.Ratio
* Make it easily restartable from an intermediate point (it might take a while and this will also allow easier parallelization)
* Use a format that will allow easy reformatting, as I plan to export to a rendering program at some point
